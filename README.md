# React Fushai

React Fushai (Shona word pronounced as *foo-shy*) is a **React** &amp; **TypeScript** made small project that basically calculates & displays the expected profit for each person.

The inspiration is taken from *Fushai*, a real life money saving technique popular in Zimbabwe where ladies (mostly) deposit a certain amount every month, then those who want to borrow some, would share from the total. The rule is no amount of money is supposed to be left - all has to be borrowed.

The money is returned after a month / on an agreed date with a certain interest. They then deposit their fixed amount and then borrow the total including the amount that was paid back by those who had borrowed.

They do this for 12 months &amp; later share the amount fairly amongst each other.
